title: User list sidebar
group: Sidebars
---

The **user list sidebar** shows when you click on:

- on the Follows or Followers counts on a user profile, or
- the boost or favorite counts on a toot.

In either case, it simply lists up users who are related: they follow or are
followed by the profile you were looking at, or they boosted or favorited the
toot you were looking at.

Of course, you can then navigate further _into_ such a user's profile by
clicking on them.

Note that a user list sidebar may often be empty, or may have far fewer entries
than you might expect. This is a side effect of the federation model in
Mastodon / the Fediverse: only profiles that your own instance is familiar with
will show up.
