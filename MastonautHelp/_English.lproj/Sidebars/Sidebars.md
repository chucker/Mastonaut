Sometimes, the main window expands to feature a **sidebar**. Unlike columns, you only see one sidebar at a time (per window)), as this information is meant to be more transient.

Sidebars appear when you click on:

- [a user profile](UserProfile.html)
- [a hashtag](Hashtag.html)
- [a status](Status.html), revealing more details such as replies
- [a status's edits](StatusEdits.html), revealing the edit history
