The **hashtag sidebar** shows when you click on a hashtag.

It lets you scroll through recent posts featuring the same hashtag. If you're interested, you can keep up with the hashtag in two ways, through the buttons at the top:

* **bookmark**ing a hashtag adds it to the menu bar, at **File** â†’ **Bookmarked Tags**. (Note that bookmarked tags do not sync across different clients.)
 * **follow**ing a hashtag adds it to your Home timeline, just like following a person.

The bookmark and follow buttons will invert if they're currently active. Clicking them again will un-bookmark or un-follow a hashtag.
