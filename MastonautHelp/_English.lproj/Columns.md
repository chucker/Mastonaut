title: Columns
---

A key concept in Mastonaut is the **column**. The main window starts out with one of them, but can grow to show multiple side-by-side. Columns show a series of statuses in the form of a timeline. They're the central way you'll look at other people's posts.

At the top of the window, each column lets you pick a **column mode**. This can be one of:

- **Home**, your personal curated timeline based on people you follow
- **Local Timeline**, which shows posts from the instance you're on
- **Public Timeline**, a firehose that shows posts from all kinds of instances
- [**Notifications**](Column Modes/Notifications.html), showing special information personal to you, such as people who have replied to you or followed you

- **Favorites** and **Bookmarks**, allowing you to browse through statuses you've previously noted down

Additionally, if you've created **Lists**, each of them will show up as an additional column mode.

Finally, the menu will contain an item **Reload this column**, and, for any column other than the first, **Remove this column**.

To _add_ another column, click the bottom at the very right of the toolbar. When pressing it, a menu lets you choose the initial column mode for the new column. Note that modes you already have columns for will not show up.
