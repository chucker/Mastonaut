**Notifications** is a special column mode that shows information pertaining to your profile, of the following types:

- **Mentions**, which are statuses that are either directly in reply to something you wrote, or mention your handle
- **New followers**
- **Follow requests**, which you may accept or decline. These notifications will only occur if your account requires manual approval of new followers.
- **Boosts** (someone boosting a status of yours)
- **Favorites** (someone favoriting a status of yours)
- **Poll results**: final results of a poll you've voted in

These notifications also integrate with macOS's Notifications system, while Mastonaut is running.

You may find that these notifications get too busy or annoying. You can:

- temporarily set macOS on a Focus mode (such as Do Not Disturb), such as by <kbd>‚å•</kbd>-clicking the clock in the menu bar;
- in System Settings, Notifications, configure Mastonaut's notifications (for example, you can disable alert sounds there);
- in Mastonaut itself, configure notifications in Preferences, Notifications. This also allows you to fine-tune _which_ types you wish to receive.
